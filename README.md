# Project 2: Tracking User Activity

In this project, you work at an ed tech firm. You've created a service that
delivers assessments, and now lots of different customers (e.g., Pearson) want
to publish their assessments on it. You need to get ready for data scientists
who work for these customers to run queries on the data. 

# Tasks

Prepare the infrastructure to land the data in the form and structure it needs
to be to be queried.  You will need to:

- Publish and consume messages with Kafka
- Use Spark to transform the messages. 
- Use Spark to transform the messages so that you can land them in HDFS

# Files in Repo

- `docker-compose.yml` - spinning the pipeline

- `project_2.ipynb` - project 2 report (business q&a, data pipeline {Docker, Kafka, Spark, HDFS [Hadoop Distributed File System]}, Spark script history, output)

- `ruby-han-history.txt` - history file has not been altered and submitted as is while lines relevant are mentioned in `project_2.ipynb` report

- `project_2_instructions.md` - original project 2 descriptions and instructions
